## Read images
Use the `load_gray2float` function to read grayscale hologram images.

## Background removal
Given a list of hologram paths, a background image is generated by the mean or mode of the brightness values at each pixel of the hologram. Lists of holograms can be obtained using the `Glob` package. It is preferable if these are time series data that record few objects. It may takes a while to process a large number of holograms. A progress bar is displayed during processing.

```julia
using ParticleHolography
using Glob

pathlist = glob("path/to/hologram/*.png")
bkg = make_background(pathlist, mode=:mode)

# Remove the background
img = load_gray2float("path/to/hologram/holo1.png")
img .= img .- bkg .+ 64/255
```

The `mode` argument can be set to `:mean` or `:mode`. The default is `:mode`.
